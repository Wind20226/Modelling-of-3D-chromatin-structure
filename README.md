# Modelling-of-3D-chromatin-structure
Only python 2.7 is supported now.

https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28529-3d-peano-space-filling-curve ：this program generates a 3D Peano space filling curve as a N X 3 matrix.

s1.py： this program generates a space curve (SAW curve) as a N X 3 matrix.

r1.py:  the polymer diffusion program. 

energytwopoint_LJpotential_spa_inclu_energyk1.py, rejectcollision_endpoint.py, rejectcollision_midddlepoint.py, rejectcollision_twopoints.py, rotatetwo.py: the programs needed for r1.py.
